# Project Overview

This project is an iOS application designed for viewing personalized movie recommendations and searching for movies using the TMDb API (The Movie Database API). It was built following the architectural pattern used in my workplace, which is a derivative of MVC (Model-View-Controller).


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on a simulator or a physical iOS device.
    
## File Structure:
The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:
1. Model: Contains the data structures and logic related to movie data retrieval and storage.
2. View: Includes all UI components and storyboard files for the application.
3. Controller: Manages the interaction between the model and the view, handling user input and updating the model accordingly.
## Usage Examples:
Browse movie recommendations based on user preferences.
Search for specific movies using the TMDb API.
View detailed information about movies, such as ratings, genres, and release dates.
